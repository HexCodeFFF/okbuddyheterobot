        "spoonful": "\u201cay dawg can I get some icecream?\u201d\n\u201conly a spoonful\u201d\nking Bach then proceeds to pull out a comically large spoon\n\nAs we can see king Bach has presented a rather large spoon to his friend. The humor in this video stems from the fact that king Bach would like to consume ice cream but his friend resorts at him saying, he can only have a spoonful, nothing more. Bach then suddenly changes his expression and body language and reveals he is indeed in possession of a spoon. And not just any spoon, it is a massive stainless steel spoon. This is funny beacuse you would never expect someone to be casually in possession of a massive spoon to eat ice cream with. It is completely unorthodox and uncalled for. This is why the video is so humorous and was put on the 2012 Epic vine compilation",
